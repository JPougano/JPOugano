### What's up!! ðŸ‘‹


My name is JoÃ£o Pedro Ougano and I'm currently a data analyst who has been passionate about software development.

Here you will find some attempts to create cool stuff while I study Front-end development.

I've been trying to absorb as much knowledge as I can and, if you want to help with suggestions and guesses, feel free to do it so!!

I'm an aspiring programmer who uses all his more than 4 years of back and forth in programming, but has decided to take it seriously a few months back!

You will still hear from me!
